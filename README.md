A machine learning model to predict diabetes
# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning model that predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic measurements such as glucose level, BMI, insulin level, etc. The model is built and tested using Python in Google Colab.
